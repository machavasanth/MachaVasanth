**Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning Techniques to classify reviews for Restaurants**
  The project "Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning Techniques to classify reviews for Restaurants" aims to develop a system that can automatically analyze and classify reviews of restaurants based on the sentiments expressed in the text. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and techniques, the system will be trained on a large dataset of restaurant reviews, enabling it to accurately determine whether a review is positive, negative, or neutral.
  Using natural language processing (NLP) methods, the system will preprocess and transform the text data, extracting relevant features that capture the sentiment of the reviews. Several machine learning algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM), linear & multi-linear regression, or neural networks will be explored to build the sentiment classification model.
  To train the model, a labeled dataset consisting of reviews with their corresponding sentiment labels will be utilized. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model.Once the model is trained and validated, it can be deployed to analyze new and unseen restaurant reviews. Users can input text reviews, and the system will apply the trained model to predict the sentiment of the inputted text. The output will indicate whether the review expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.
